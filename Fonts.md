## Cascadia Code versions

There are multiple versions of Cascadia Code available that include ligatures and glyphs. All versions of Cascadia Code can be downloaded from the [Cascadia Code GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases). Windows Terminal ships Cascadia Code and Cascadia Mono in its package and uses Cascadia Mono by default.

## [Powerline and programming ligatures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/cascadia-code#powerline-and-programming-ligatures)

Powerline is a common command-line plugin that allows you to display additional information in your prompt. It uses a few additional glyphs to display this information properly.

Programming ligatures are glyphs that are created by combining characters. They are most useful when writing code. The "Code" variants include ligatures, whereas the "Mono" variants exclude them.
