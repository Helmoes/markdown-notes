# Now
- [ ] Can linux use NTFS soft/hard links or URI?
- [ ] schematic motor & current sensor
- [x] linux/unix file naming
- [x] install bat on kuvm
- [ ] tmux
    - [ ] install on wsl
    - [ ] hotkeys & commands
- [ ] ll output meaning
- [ ] 

# Next work moment
- [ ] [[Linux#Drivers]] -> tab group 'VMware'
    - **FIRST BACKUP** so we can use diff software for see what changed after nvidia driver install
    - No DKMS -> use xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-515 (binary Xorg driver) instead?
    - Use `lspci` & `kmod`
    - Maybe modify `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` to load correct driver
    - Does nvidia driver/Xorg have commands to disable driver at next boot?
    - [You should also make sure that you don't have an xorg.conf file which is explicitly selecting the nvidia driver since this will fail.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/779155/switch-video-drivers-in-dual-boot-environment)
