# Next work moment
- [ ] [[Linux#Drivers]] -> tab group 'VMware'
    - **FIRST BACKUP** so we can use diff software for see what changed after nvidia driver install
    - No DKMS -> use xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-515 (binary Xorg driver) instead?
    - Use `lspci` & `kmod`
    - Maybe modify `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` to load correct driver
    - Does nvidia driver/Xorg have commands to disable driver at next boot?
    - [You should also make sure that you don't have an xorg.conf file which is explicitly selecting the nvidia driver since this will fail.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/779155/switch-video-drivers-in-dual-boot-environment)
