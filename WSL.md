In PowerShell:
```powershell
wsl -l -v
wsl --shutdown
```

While WSL can be disposable, it's also a good idea to back up your installations so if you do get rid of one you can get back to where you were a little easier.

Backing up is a pretty straightforward process that involves exporting to a .tar file. Our guides on exporting and importing Linux installs in WSL will take you through the process step by step, but the main commands you need are as follows:

```powershell
wsl --export <distro> <filename.tar>wsl --import <distro> <install location=""> <filename> </filename></install></distro></filename.tar></distro>
```


```powershell
wsl --export Ubuntu_20_04 C:\WSL2-Distros\backups\Ubuntu_20_04_2022(INSERT DATE!!!).tar
```

```bash
wslpath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe"
```
