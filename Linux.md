# Sessions
`Session` usually refers to shell sessions. A [shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29) is what allows you to interact with the computer. It acts as a bridge qbetween the user and the [kernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29). Whenever you run a command, it is the shell that captures your intent and tells the kernel to do its thing.

In most Linux flavors, the default shell is `bash` and a new `bash` session will be launched every time you open a new terminal.

```bash
pstree -aps
```
