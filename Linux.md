# Useful commands
## Aliases
```bash
alias ll='ls -alF'
```

## wildcards in commands (glob, globbing)
- `*`: all single characters or any string.
- `?`: one character
- `[]`: any character within the brackets
- `[!chars]`: anything except characters inside brackets

## `cat` & `bat`
The cat command, short for concatenate, not only displays file contents but can combine multiple files and show you the output of them. It’s not great for viewing large files and it’s only meant for short content.
```bash
cat foo.txt
```
### `bat` installation
```bash
wget https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/download/v0.22.1/bat_0.22.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i bat_0.22.1_amd64.deb
bat --generate-config-file
```

## `less`, `more`
Use `less,` not `more`. 
Type `h` for keybindings.
- `d`: half page down
- `u`: half page up
- `g`: to beginning of file
- `G`: to end of file

## Downloading from internet with `wget`
```bash
wget https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases/download/v0.22.1/bat_0.22.1_amd64.deb
```

# Save shell history
Append the new history lines to the history file. These are history lines entered since the beginning of the current Bash session, but not already appended to the history file.
```bash
history -a
```

Added to .bash_history on 23.08 02:09 
```bash
shopt -s histappend
PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a;$PROMPT_COMMAND"
```

## bash save history without exit
[source](https://superuser.com/questions/555310/bash-save-history-without-exit)
**Bash History**
Any new commands that have been issued in the active terminal can be appended to the `.bash_history` file with the following command:
```bash
history -a
```
The only tricky concept to understand is that each terminal has its own bash history **list** (loaded from the `.bash_history` file when you open the terminal)
If you want to pull any new history that's been written by other terminals during the lifetime of this active terminal, you can append the contents of the `.bash_history` **file** to the active bash history **list** 
```bash
history -c;history -r
```
This will clear the current history list so we don't get a repeated list, and append the history file to the (now empty) list.

**Solution**
You can use the bash variable `PROMPT_COMMAND` to issue a command with each new prompt (every time you press enter in the terminal)
```bash
export PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'
```
This will record each command to the history **file** as it is issued.

**Result**
Now any new terminal you open will have the history of other terminals without having to `exit` those other terminals. This is my preferred workflow.

**More Precision**
Let's say (for some reason) you have two terminals that you're using simultaneously and you want the history to reflect between both for each new command.
```bash
export PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a;history -c;history -r'
```
The main drawback here is that you may need to press enter to re-run the PROMPT_COMMAND in order to get the latest history from the opposite terminal.
You can see why this more precise option is probably overkill, but it works for that use case.

# Bash startup
Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.

When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell executes the `exit` builtin command, Bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists. 

So: /etc/profile → ~/.bash profile → ~/.bash login → ~/.profile
>source https://devdocs.io/bash/bash-startup-files

To add directories to your PATH or define additional environment variables, place those changes in `.bash_profile` (Ubuntu uses `.profile).` For everything else, place the changes in `.bashrc`.

# File system
- /bin, /usr/bin: contains basic programs (binaries) like cat, ls, awk, etc. These two directories contain most of the programs for the system. The /bin directory has the essential programs that the system requires to operate, while /usr/bin contains applications for the system's users.
- /boot: contains files necessary to boot the system and contains kernel.
- /etc: contains critical system configuration files.
    - /etc/init.d: This directory contains the scripts that start various system services at boot time.
- /home: contains users' directories EXCEPT one special user.
- /lib: contains system libraries.
- /opt: contains optional installations.
- /proc: directory is a virtual directory, allowing direct interaction with the running Linux Kernel.
- /root: is the home directory of the specialuser called root.
- /sbin, /usr/sbin: The sbin directories contain programs for system administration, mostly for use by the superuser.
- /tmp: contains temporary files.
- /usr: contains programs like Firefox, VLC, LibreOffice, games. contains a variety of things that support user applications.
    - /usr/local: and its subdirectories are used for the installation of software and other files for use on the local machine. What this really means is that software that is not part of the official distribution (which usually goes in /usr/bin) goes here.When you find interesting programs to install on your system, they should be installed in one of the /usr/local directories. Most often, the directory of choice is /usr/local/bin.
- /var: contains system logs and runtime files.

# Environment variables
Two types: shell and environment.

# Processes

1. UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
2. BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
3. GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

# Sessions
`Session` usually refers to shell sessions. A [shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29) is what allows you to interact with the computer. It acts as a bridge between the user and the [kernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29). Whenever you run a command, it is the shell that captures your intent and tells the kernel to do its thing.

In most Linux flavors, the default shell is `bash` and a new `bash` session will be launched every time you open a new terminal.

## `tmux` - terminal multiplexer
```bash
# start tmux
tmux
# start tmux and name session
tmux new -s my_session
# attach to running session
tmux attach -t my_session
tmux kill-server && tmux
```

```bash
# ~/.tmux.conf
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
set -g mouse on
```

# Kubuntu
## Drivers
[Ubuntu Manpage: lspci - list all PCI devices](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man8/lspci.8.html)
`lspci` is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the system and devices connected to them.
By default, it shows a brief list of devices. Use the options described below to request either a more verbose output or output intended for parsing by other programs.

Options:
```bash
lspci
# Show a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges, devices and connections between them.
-t 
# Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel modules capable of handling it. Turned on by default when -v is given in the normal mode of output. (Currently works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)
-k
```

`dmesg` 

`lsmod` - Show the status of modules in the Linux Kernel. nicely formats the contents of the /proc/modules, showing what kernel modules are currently loaded.

Driver modules dir: `/lib/modules/5.15.0-48-generic/`
