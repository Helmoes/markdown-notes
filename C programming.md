```bash
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world -std=gnu11
./hello_world

gcc cards.c -o cards -std=gnu11 -Wall -Wextra -ggdb && ./cards
```
`-o file` Place the primary output in file *file*.

The `stdio.h` library contains code that allows you to read and write data from and to the terminal.

Return type of main() is `int` → 0 means success. 

Compilation can involve up to four stages: **preprocessing**, **compilation proper**, **assembly** and **linking**, always in that order. GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several files either into several assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file. [source](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options)

## main()
- Start of program.
- Return type: `int` → 0 means success.

To use cli arguments and options main is declared like this: (p. 141)
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Check for number of arguments
    if (argc != 6)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You need to give 5 arguments\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use arv[] as strings
    FILE *file1 = fopen(argv[2], "w");
}
```
The main function reads the cli arguments as an array of strings(character pointers to strings technically).
**`argv[0]` is name of program -> first cli argument is `argv[1].`**

## switch()
- Can replace a sequence of `if` statements.
- Will continue to run until `break` or end of switch statement.
- Check for correct breaks.

## atoi()
Part of stdlib.h
Interprets an integer value in a byte string pointed to by `str`.
Integer value corresponding to the contents of `str` on success.
If no conversion can be performed, `0` is returned.
The name stands for "ASCII to integer".

# Declaration & initialization
```c
int var=value;
int var1, var2, var3;
var1 = var2 = 7;
```
Use 'unsigned'. Default is signed.

# Functions
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.

# Pointers
To get address of variable use `&`.

Create a pointer variable:
```c
int *p_address_of_x = &x;
```

Read address contents:
```c
int value_stored = *p_address_of_x;
```

`*` operator is said to dereference a pointer. **It reads and be used to set the contents of a memory address**.

Change contents of address:
```c
*p_address_of_x = 99;
```

Template:
```c
void function(int *p_var1, int *p_var2)
{
    *p_var1 = ... + *p_var2;
}

int main()
{
    int var1;
    int var2;
    function(&var1, &var2);
}
```

## Arrays
Array variable is pointer to lowest memory address of array.
Using & on the array var will result in the array itself.

Member access through pointer to a struct or union:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
struct s {int x;};
int main(void)
{
    struct s s={1}, *p = &s;
    p->x = 7; // changes the value of s.x through the pointer
    printf("%d\n", p->x); // prints 7
}
```

# GCC options
Put GCC compile command as comment in first line
```bash
// gcc -std=c99 -o go go.c neuron.c -lm -Wall -Werror
// gcc -g -Wall -o add add.c -lm
gcc ${fileBasename}.c -fdiagnostics-color=always -ggdb -std=gnu17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o ./bin/${fileBasenameNoExtension}
```
Debugging: 
```c
-g 
-ggdb
```

# Strings
Strings are arrays of chars. The array variable is a pointer to the first element in the array, not the contents of the array/string itself!
`char *s = "some string";` this is not modifiable (string literal).

## scanf() p.65
`%[width]s` matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters (a string).
If `width` specifier is used, matches up to width or until the first whitespace character, whichever appears first. **Always stores a null character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least width+1 characters**). [scanf, fscanf, sscanf, scanf_s, fscanf_s, sscanf_s - cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fscanf)

scanf needs pointers to char array or variables.
```c
int age;
scanf("%i", &age);
```

**Return value:** Number of receiving arguments successfully assigned (which may be zero in case a matching failure occurred before the first receiving argument was assigned), or [EOF](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io "c/io") if input failure occurs before the first receiving argument was assigned.

# Files
p. 138

We can create our own data streams. Each data stream is represented by a pointer to a file, and you can create a new data stream using the fopen() function:
```c
FILE *in_file = fopen("input.txt", "r");
FILE *out_file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
```

The fopen() function takes two parameters: a filename and a mode. The mode can be **w** to write to a file, **r** to read from a file, or **a** to append data to the end of a file.
Once you’ve created a data stream, you can print to it using fprintf(). Or read from it with fscanf().

```c
fprintf(out_file, "Don't wear %s with %s", "red", "green");
fscanf(in_file, "%79[^\n]\n", sentence);
```

When finished the data stream needs to be closed.
```c
fclose(in_file);
fclose(out_file);
```

Error checking on opening file:
```c
FILE *in;
if (!(in = fopen("dont_exist.txt", "r")))
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Can't open the file.\n");
    return 1;
}
```

## Data streams
Amount of data streams we can use depends on OS, but usually up to 256.


# Standard input/output/error
Scanf() and printf() use std in and out. The Standard Input and Standard Output are created by the operating system when the program runs.
The program receives data through the Standard Input, The program outputs data through the Standard Output.

The operating system controls how data gets into and out of the Standard Input and Output. If you run a program from the command prompt or terminal, the operating system will send all of the keystrokes from the keyboard into the Standard Input. If the operating system reads any data from the Standard Output, by default it will send that data to the display. 

The scanf() and printf() functions don’t know, or care, where the data comes from or goes to. They just read and write Standard Input and the Standard Output.

**You can redirect the Standard Input and Standard Output so that they read (<) and write (>) data somewhere else, such as to and from files. Use >> to append and not overwrite.** [Redirections (Bash Reference Manual)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html)
```bash
./ex_p105 < gpsdata.csv > output.json
```

Redirect stderr
```bash
./ex_p105 >2 output.json
```

Redirect stdout and stderror:
```bash
&>word # or &>>word
# or
>word 2>&1
# Of the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically equivalent
```

In c code using `fprintf()`:
```c
fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", word);
```

See exit status of last command:
```bash
echo $?
```

## Connecting stdin & stdout with pipes |
```bash
(./bermuda | ./geo2json) < spooky.csv > output.json
```


# Memory
Regions: static data, stack (automatic), heap (programmer controlled).
## Static data
- Lifetime: entire program duration
- Size: fixed, known at compile time
- ex: global variables

### Global or `static` variables
- Global are always `static`
- Have one copy
- Declaring variable in function as `static` → won't be destroyed after function returns

## Stack (automatic)
- Lifetime: temporary, stores local variables during function calls
- Size: grows when calling nested functions
- Grows high to low address
- 'normal' variables → get destroyed after function returns
- variables get allocated and destroyed automatically
- Faster than heap
- Less control
- LIFO

## Heap (dynamic)
- Lifetime: discretion of programmer
- Size: discretion of programmer
- `malloc()` and `free()`

# Headers, libraries and linking

For functions in external .c file: header file can be thought of as interface between source code and the programmer.

.h file contains function declarations or definitions to be used in main program. A .c file can contain the rest of the function definitions of only declarations are given in .h

Never put anything other than function prototypes/declarations, variable declarations, includes and macros inside a header file.

Use compiler option `-Idir` to link to directory not in current.
