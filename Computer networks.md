# Localhost
Localhost is a hostname that refers to the computer system on which the calling program is running, which means the machine will talk to itself when we call localhost.
When using “localhost” the network services are accessed through the logical network interface called loopback. The IP address of the loopback interface is 127.0.0.1.
